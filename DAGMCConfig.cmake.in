# This file defines the following variables:
# DAGMC_FOUND        - boolean indicating that DAGMC is found
# DAGMC_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories from which to pick up DAGMC includes
# DAGMC_LIBRARIES    - libraries need to link to DAGMC; use this in target_link_libraries for DAGMC-dependent targets
# DAGMC_CXX, DAGMC_CC, DAGMC_F77, DAGMC_FC - compilers used to compile DAGMC
# DAGMC_CXXFLAGS, DAGMC_CCFLAGS, DAGMC_FFLAGS, DAGMC_FCFLAGS - compiler flags used to compile DAGMC; possibly need to use these in add_definitions or CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<MODE>
